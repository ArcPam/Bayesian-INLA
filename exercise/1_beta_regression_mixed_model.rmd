# Introduction to the problem

Circular leaf spot (CLS), caused by *Plurivorosphaerella nawae*, is a serious disease affecting persimmon that is characterized by:

 - Necrotic lesions on leaves,

 - Defoliation, and 

 - Fruit drop. 

 
Under Mediterranean conditions, *P. nawae* forms pseudothecia in the leaf litter in winter, and ascospores are released in spring, infecting susceptible leaves. Persimmon growers are advised to apply fungicides for CLS control during the period of inoculum availability, which was previously defined based on ascospore counts under the microscope. A model of inoculum availability of *P.  nawaew* has been developed and evaluated as an alternative to ascospore counts. Leaf litter samples were collected weekly in L’Alcudia (Spain) from 2010 to 2015. Leaves were soaked and placed in a wind tunnel, and the released ascospores of *P. nawae were counted. 
 

# Importing the data from L'Alcúdia
The models were constructed using the data from L'Alcúdia. The variables available are:

1. *y*: response variable. It is the proportion of ascospores. Note that in this exercise, the response variable has been previously transformed using the function ***DR_data*** from the package ***DirichletReg***.

2. *year*: the year where the proportion of ascospores has been measured.

3. *dd*: acumulatted degree days. Biofix 01-01 and Tbase = 0ºC.
